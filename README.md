# Credit Card Analytics Dashboard  
**Power BI + PostgreSQL | Data Analytics | Customer Segmentation**

---

## 📘 Project Description

The **Credit Card Analytics Dashboard** is a comprehensive business intelligence solution built using **Power BI**, **PostgreSQL**, **SQL**, and **DAX**. It analyzes over **656,000 credit card transactions** and customer profiles to uncover strategic insights into revenue trends, customer satisfaction, transaction behavior, and product performance.

This solution is designed for financial institutions to support data-driven decisions by visualizing key metrics such as revenue, interest, transaction types, activation rates, and customer segmentation — all through interactive, executive-ready dashboards.

## 🎯 Purpose & Vision

As someone passionate about solving business problems using data, I wanted to create a comprehensive solution that mirrors real-world analytics use cases in the financial domain. Credit card companies deal with massive customer data, but often struggle to turn it into actionable insights.

This project was built to:

* Practice and showcase end-to-end BI workflow using realistic datasets
* Deliver business-ready KPIs and dashboards using industry-standard tools
* Demonstrate how data storytelling can support decision-making in finance and customer analytics

## 🔧 Development Workflow

The project involved building a complete BI solution from scratch — from data ingestion to insight generation. Here's the step-by-step process I followed:

1. **Data Collection**
   Imported CSVs representing transaction-level (`credit_card.csv`) and customer demographic data (`customer.csv`).

2. **Database Setup**
   Loaded the data into **PostgreSQL**, created relational tables, and cleaned/joined them using **SQL**.

3. **Data Preparation**
   Connected PostgreSQL to Power BI using **ODBC**. Used **Power Query** to clean column types, handle nulls, and shape data for modeling.

4. **Data Modeling**
   Created a **star schema** with fact and dimension tables. Defined relationships and hierarchies to support filtering and slicing.

5. **DAX & KPI Measures**
   Built 25+ **DAX measures** for business metrics like:

   * Revenue & Interest
   * Customer Satisfaction Score (CSS)
   * Activation Rate & Delinquency Rate
   * Quarterly Growth & Segmentation by category

6. **Dashboard Design**
   Developed two Power BI report pages:

   * **Transaction Report** – revenue, usage mode, card type, quarter-wise trends
   * **Customer Report** – demographic segmentation, satisfaction trends, revenue contribution

7. **Insight Generation**
   Used slicers, drill-downs, and conditional formatting to uncover patterns and deliver business insights backed by data.

## 📊 Project Insights

* **Q3** reported the highest revenue (\$14.2M) and transaction volume (166.6K)
* **Blue** and **Silver** cards make up **93% of usage**; Platinum is underutilized
* **Swipe** transactions dominate at \$35M; Online is only \$3M
* **Top customer group**: Businessmen (\$17.3M), Graduates (\$22M)
* **Top states**: TX, NY, CA — together account for **68%** of revenue
* **CSS avg**: 3.19 | **Activation rate**: 57.5% | **Delinquency rate**: 6.06%
